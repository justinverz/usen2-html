    <h4>
        <p>Ode Usen, also known as Ufe kekere and Ode Awure is the name of a small town in Edo state,
             Nigeria. It also doubles as the name of a Yoruba subgroup consisting of culturally related
            villages situated between Ofosu in the west and Ogbese in the east.[1] Usen is surrounded
            on all sides by smaller villages and farmsteads known in the local Yoruba dialect as Egunre.
             some of the villages under the authority of Usen include; Arere, Oladaro, Arekpa, Ogunweyin, 
            Ogidigbo, Ilorin (Ulorin), Ukankan, Ajegunle, Obome, Aghakpo, Leleji, Ofaran, Okeodo, Adeyanba.
            [2] These villages were all founded by people from Usen and speak the same dialect of the Yoruba language.
            There are also other communities that speak the same dialect of the Yoruba language as Usen, such as; Egbeta,
             Utese and Igue Ogho between Ekiadọlọ and Usen.[3]</p>
